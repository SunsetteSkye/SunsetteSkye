				<p><span style="font: normal normal normal 125% FontSaddlebag;">THE SUNDERED MARCHES</span> is a comedic action-drama series for Young Adults, placed in a steampunk wild west. The series follows the Lanvan Revolutionary Aerie's war of independence against the Imperial Duvencht Military.</p>

				<p>Perched deep in a canyon rich with magic and minerals, Lanva March is the heart of a mechanical, industrial revolution: manufactories replacing guilds, wingpacks instead of flying mounts, farms run by machines instead of men. It's going to save a lot of time and make a lot of money -- money that could change the life of every Marcher in that dry, dusty land. But it could also save the aristocracy of the Duvencht Empire, a once-great magical hegemon now wracked by corruption, disease, and resurgent rivals.</p>

				<p>Between the two nations stands an array of covens, monsters, robber barons, and erstwhile conquerors who have their own shifting allegiances. Only the Heavenly Ministry has any idea how it's all going to play out, and the ministers are a little bit busy dealing with the moon: it's kind of bleeding!</p>

				<p>Written by seasoned¹, award-winning² author Cynthia Skye, it currently consists of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09VXDS5VG?ref_=pe_3052080_276849420">one novel</a>, various upcoming short stories, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwJgwg0umyo&list=PL1XJlM2WvCIMpg_J8xsCXv6ymeCVUCZYB">a fully-fledged soundtrack</a> composed by Daniel Wilson.</p><br><br>
